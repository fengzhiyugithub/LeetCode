Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.

public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        int cnt1[256]= {0},cnt2[256]= {0};
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            if(cnt1[s[i]]!=cnt2[t[i]])
                return false;
            cnt1[s[i]]=cnt2[t[i]]=i+1;
        }
        return true;
    }
